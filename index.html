                  It doesn't look so great when we look at the total amount of
                  energy we can produce when using renewable energy sources. It
                  turns out that despite having fewer plants, gas and coal can
                  produce four times as much energy as sun and wind. This is a
                  huge problem if we want to reduce our carbon emissions and

                  The number and capacity of power plants has changed profoundly
                  over the last century. From the graph, we can see that the
                  number of solar- and wind-powered plants is growing
                  dramatically, while new gas and coal power plants occur not so
                  often. It is a trend which we were expected to see, knowing of
                  the environmental benefits of using solar and wind power, as
                  well as the need for new energy sources due to climate change.

                <p class="block__content">
                  However, it is not clear that the overall capacity of these
                  renewable energy sources is increasing at the same rate as the
                  number of constructions being built.

                  Letâ€™s draw the trend line, assuming that progress regarding
                  the number of new plants built and their capacity will keep
                  the same pace as it has over the last 10 years.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  The prediction line shows us that gas power plants will
                  surpass those that use coal as the power source in both
                  quantity and overall capacity.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  The situation is different for renewable sources of energy.
                  Although the number of wind plants has already exceeded coal
                  and gas ones, and solar stations are going to do the same
                  soon, the power capacity of these energy sources is increasing
                  at the same rate as their opponents.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  This means that, despite a lot of new wind and solar power
                  plants being built, their number is clearly not enough to
                  surpass the capacity of fossil fuel-powered plants. And maybe,
                  even for sustaining our needs.

                From the beginning, we can see that China stands out. But this country also has the greatest population and production industry on Earth, which explains why it needs all this energy. The USA catches the eye next. This country is also well-populated and has a big industrial complex, so the data may be distorted too. The same can be said about Brazil.

                  It is noticeable that African countries use more solar than wind energy. Mexico also has a denser colour on this map, and Chile does too. When we look at Europe, we see that, unlike with wind, Spain has clear leadership regarding using solar energy. Australia uses solar energy slightly more than wind. And all of this was expected: these countries have more sunny days, hence the reason for using more solar panels.</p>

                  China and the USA have the greatest power-producing capacity when it comes to solar energy, but here is something interesting about the United Kingdom: although this country produces less solar energy than it does with wind, and despite being well-known as "Foggy Albion", it is still able to extract more energy from the sun than most African countries.</p>

                  We have our winner! Sweden produces the most energy with solar and wind power compared to the capacity of its fossil fuel plants. To be honest, I was surprised to see Estonia on this list. I didn't know that this is such a "green" country. Likewise, Honduras is one that I didn't expect to see on this list. I personally thought it would be filled mostly with North-European countries.
