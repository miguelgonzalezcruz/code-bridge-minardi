                  It doesn’t look so great when we look at the total amount of
                  energy we can produce using solar and wind power. It turns
                  out, that despite having fewer plants, gas and coal can
                  produce 4 times as much energy as sun and wind. This is a huge
                  problem if we want to reduce our carbon emissions and reduce
                  our reliance on fossil fuels.

                  The last century has seen a profound change in the number and
                  capacity of power plants.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  From the graph, we can see that the number of solar- and
                  wind-powered plants is growing dramatically, while new gas and
                  coal power plants occur not so often. It is a trend which we
                  were expected to see, knowing of the environmental benefits of
                  using solar and wind power, as well as the need for new energy
                  sources due to climate change.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  However, it is not clear that the overall capacity of these
                  renewable energy sources is increasing at the same rate as the
                  number of constructions being built.

                  Let’s draw the trend line, assuming that progress regarding
                  the number of new plants built and their capacity will keep
                  the same pace as it has over the last 10 years.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  The prediction line shows us that gas power plants will
                  surpass those that use coal as the power source in both
                  quantity and overall capacity.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  The situation is different for renewable sources of energy.
                  Although the number of wind plants has already exceeded coal
                  and gas ones, and solar stations are going to do the same
                  soon, the power capacity of these energy sources is increasing
                  at the same rate as their opponents.
                </p>
                <p class="block__content">
                  This means that, despite a lot of new wind and solar power
                  plants being built, their number is clearly not enough to
                  surpass the capacity of fossil fuel-powered plants. And maybe,
                  even for sustaining our needs.
